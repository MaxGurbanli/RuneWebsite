            <h3>Pets</h3>

            <b>I am excited to announce the newest addition to Rune's Economy: Pets!</b> <br><br>

            Take care of pets and they will take care of you!<br><br>
            
            Pets have stats that need to be controlled to keep them happy. This is done by playing with, washing, and feeding your pet. In return, happy pets will bring you goodies every day!<br><br>
            
            The following commands have been added:<br>
            /pet shop<br>
            /pet buy<br>
            /pet view<br>
            /pet play<br>
            /pet feed<br>
            /pet wash<br>

            <h3>Command Usage Updates</h3>
            
            Some command usage changes are being made for consistency across all commands and to free up space for more commands to be added!<br><br>
            
            <b>Slash commands</b><br>
            /shop --> /shop view<br>
            /buy --> /shop buy<br>
            /sell --> /shop sell<br>
            /inventory --> /inventory view<br>
            /use --> /inventory use<br>
            /balance --> /balance view<br>
            /upgrade --> /balance upgrade<br>
            /upgrades --> /balance upgades<br><br>
            
            <b>Message commands</b><br>
            !!shop, !!inventory, and !!balance can still be used without having "view" at the end, in these cases Rune just displays the "view" version of the command.<br><br>
            
            However, sell, buy, use, upgrade and upgrades can only be used as subcommands from now on (i.e. !!shop buy, !!inventory use, etc...)

            <h2>Update v2.13</h2>

            Economy profile badges are now <b>available to purchase</b>! These <b>appear on your Economy profile</b> when someone views your /balance.<br><br>

            The badges command is now a group command, meaning you can provide a subcommand.<br><br>

            The following subcommands have been added:<br>
            <cmd>
              badges view (default)<br>
              badges list<br>
              badges buy [badge]<br>
              badges hide [badge]<br>
              badges unhide [badge]<br><br>
            </cmd>

            I suggest using the buy, hide, and unhide commands with the / prefix because there's an autocomplete for badge selection!<br><br>

            Badges cost 100 coins.<br><br>

            Other changes<br>
            - <cmd>!!profile</cmd> can now be used as an alias to <cmd>!!balance</cmd><br>
            - Added "Heists" information card to tutorial<br>
            - The Big Banker badge (account worth 5000+) now always appears at the top<br>
            - Other minor improvements
